SailPoint Rules Documentation Summary

A **rule** in SailPoint is a piece of custom logic that defines how SailPoint should handle specific operations or data processing tasks. Rules are essential for customizing and extending the functionality of SailPoint IdentityIQ beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities.

### **1. What is a Rule?**

A rule is essentially a block of code that runs within SailPoint to perform a specific action or make decisions based on conditions. Rules are used to handle various aspects of identity and access management, such as provisioning, de-provisioning, and data transformations.

### **2. Types of Rules**

1. **Provisioning Rules**: Manage how identities are provisioned or de-provisioned in applications.
2. **Aggregation Rules**: Handle data import and transformation when aggregating data from external sources.
3. **Access Review Rules**: Define logic for access review processes.
4. **Identity Attribute Rules**: Modify or validate attributes of identities.
5. **Custom Rules**: Any other rule that provides custom logic for specific use cases.

### **3. Why Developers Use Rules**

Developers use rules to customize SailPoint to meet specific business needs or integrate with external systems. Here’s why rules are crucial:

1. **Customization**: SailPoint provides default functionality, but businesses often need custom logic to handle unique processes or data formats.
2. **Integration**: Rules facilitate integration with external systems by defining how data should be transformed or synchronized.
3. **Automation**: Rules automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency.
4. **Validation**: Rules help validate data and ensure it meets specific business requirements before it’s processed or stored.
5. **Flexibility**: Rules offer the flexibility to modify how SailPoint behaves in different scenarios, such as handling exceptions or implementing special business rules.

### **4. How Developers Use Rules**

Developers create and deploy rules to define custom logic. Here’s how they typically use them:

#### **4.1 Writing Rules**

- **Language**: Rules can be written in BeanShell or Java. BeanShell is a scripting language that allows for dynamic scripting, while Java provides more robust and complex functionality.
- **Editor**: Developers use the SailPoint rule editor to write and test their rules.

#### **4.2 Example Use Cases**

1. **Provisioning Rule**:
   - **Scenario**: Automatically set a password for a new user in an application when they are provisioned.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```java
     public class SetProvisioningPassword extends Rule {
         @Override
         public void execute(Identity identity, Application app) {
             String password = generateSecurePassword();
             identity.setPassword(password);
             context.saveObject(identity);
         }
         
         private String generateSecurePassword() {
             // Generate a secure random password
             return "NewSecurePassword123!";
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Aggregation Rule**:
   - **Scenario**: Transform data from an external HR system to fit SailPoint’s data model.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```java
     public class TransformHRData extends Rule {
         @Override
         public void execute(Identity identity) {
             String hrData = identity.getAttribute("hrField");
             String transformedData = hrData.toUpperCase();
             identity.setAttribute("transformedField", transformedData);
             context.saveObject(identity);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Access Review Rule**:
   - **Scenario**: Customize how access reviews are presented or processed.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```java
     public class CustomAccessReviewRule extends Rule {
         @Override
         public void execute(Review review) {
             // Custom logic to process access reviews
             if (review.getStatus().equals("Pending")) {
                 review.setAttribute("reviewNote", "Requires urgent attention");
                 context.saveObject(review);
             }
         }
     }
     ```

### **5. How Rules are Triggered**

Rules are triggered by specific events or processes in SailPoint, such as:

- **Provisioning**: When identities are added or updated.
- **Aggregation**: During data imports from external systems.
- **Access Reviews**: When access reviews are created or processed.
- **Custom Events**: When specific conditions or actions occur in SailPoint.

### **6. Summary**

- **Definition**: A rule is custom logic written to handle specific tasks or conditions in SailPoint.
- **Purpose**: Customization, integration, automation, validation, and flexibility.
- **Usage**: Developers write and deploy rules to modify SailPoint’s behavior to fit their organization's needs.

Rules are a powerful way to extend SailPoint’s capabilities and ensure that it meets the specific requirements of your organization. By writing and deploying rules, developers can tailor SailPoint to handle complex business processes and integrate seamlessly with other systems.
