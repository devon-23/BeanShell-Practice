Reports in SailPoint IdentityIQ allow users to gather and present data about the system, identities, access privileges, application details, and more. Reports are crucial for auditing, compliance, and general system monitoring.

**Reports in SailPoint** are like tools that gather and show information about what’s happening in the system. They help you answer questions like:

- Who has access to what?
- Which accounts are active or inactive?
- Are there any security policy violations?
- How are access reviews (certifications) going?

Reports let you organize this data into easy-to-read summaries, which you can view, save, or share for audits, tracking, or decision-making. They help you understand how identities, applications, and access are managed within SailPoint.

### **Types of Reports**

SailPoint provides two main categories of reports:
1. **Out-of-the-box Reports**: Predefined reports that are built into SailPoint. These cover common use cases such as identity access, certification results, or policy violations.
2. **Custom Reports**: You can create reports tailored to specific needs using SailPoint’s report engine, including custom filters and query options.

### **Key Components of SailPoint Reports**
- **Report Definition**: This contains the parameters, filters, and display fields for the report.
- **Report Filters**: Filters allow users to narrow down data based on specific criteria, such as specific identities, roles, or applications.
- **Report Results**: The actual data generated based on the filters and fields chosen in the report definition.

### **Steps to Create a Report**
1. **Accessing the Reports Module**: Navigate to the "Reports" section in SailPoint.
2. **Choosing a Template**:
   - Select from predefined reports, or choose “Create Custom Report” to build your own.
3. **Configuring Report Filters**:
   - Specify criteria such as Identity Attributes, Application Details, or Event Types.
   - Use logical conditions (AND/OR) to refine the data.
4. **Defining Report Output**:
   - Select which columns/fields to display in the report output.
   - You can also specify sorting and grouping of data here.
5. **Running the Report**:
   - After setting up the report, you can run it immediately or schedule it for a future time.
6. **Exporting the Report**:
   - Reports can be exported in formats such as PDF, Excel, or CSV for further analysis.

### **Out-of-the-Box Reports (Examples)**
- **Access Review Results Report**: Displays details on completed access reviews, including the review decisions and results.
- **Identity Report**: Shows detailed information on selected identities, such as access rights, certifications, and roles.
- **Entitlement Report**: Displays entitlements across applications for identities.

### **Custom Reports in SailPoint**
Custom reports allow for flexible querying of SailPoint data using:
- **Data Sources**: This could be identities, applications, roles, or even specific events.
- **Custom SQL Queries**: Advanced users can create complex reports using SQL-based queries.
  
### **Reporting for Audits and Compliance**
- Reports are often used for audit purposes, such as tracking policy violations, role assignments, or certification processes.
- You can schedule reports to automatically generate and email results for regular audits.

### **Best Practices for Report Creation**
1. **Understand the Data Model**: Knowing the key objects like Identity, Role, Entitlement, and Application is important for defining meaningful reports.
2. **Minimize Performance Impact**: Avoid creating reports with broad filters that can slow down the system. Instead, refine the query with specific criteria.
3. **Use Scheduled Reports**: For recurring reports, schedule them to run at off-peak hours to avoid system performance hits.
4. **Security Considerations**: Ensure reports comply with access control policies so that only authorized users can view sensitive information.

### **Key Terms to Remember**
- **Filters**: Criteria to limit the scope of the report (e.g., by application, date range, identity).
- **Columns**: Data fields that will be shown in the report results.
- **Scheduled Report**: A report that runs at a pre-configured time automatically.
- **Custom SQL Reports**: Reports created using custom SQL queries for more complex data extraction.
