### **Week 9: SailPoint API and External Integrations**

In this week, you'll learn how to interact with SailPoint programmatically through APIs. SailPoint provides **REST** and **SCIM** APIs, which allow you to perform operations like provisioning, querying identities, and managing entitlements from external systems.

#### **1. REST API Overview**
SailPoint REST API provides a way to programmatically interact with IdentityIQ. This is useful for integrating with external applications, automating processes, and building custom tools.

- **Key REST API Operations**:
  - **GET**: Retrieve data (e.g., identity details, list of roles).
  - **POST**: Create new resources (e.g., new identity, assign roles).
  - **PUT**: Update existing resources.
  - **DELETE**: Remove resources.

#### **2. SCIM API Overview**
SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a protocol designed for managing user identities in cloud-based applications. SailPoint supports SCIM to synchronize identities across multiple platforms.

- **SCIM Functions**:
  - **Create and Manage Users**: Automatically add or update users in external systems.
  - **Provision and Deprovision**: Sync identity and access changes in real-time with other platforms.

#### **3. Hands-on Practice**
- **Task 1: Call SailPoint's REST API**
  - Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to make REST API calls.
  - Example: Retrieve user data from SailPoint:
    ```bash
    GET /identity/identities/{identityId}
    ```
    - URL: `https://your-sailpoint-instance/identityiq/rest/identities/{identityId}`
    - Method: `GET`
    - Add API key or authentication token to make the request.
    
- **Task 2: Integrate SCIM for Identity Management**
  - Set up SCIM API integration between SailPoint and a cloud app (like Office 365).
  - Configure SCIM endpoint and test user provisioning.

#### **4. Best Practices**
- **Authentication**: Always use secure authentication methods, like OAuth 2.0 or API tokens.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for API calls. For example, handle cases where the API response fails due to invalid tokens or system errors.
- **Performance Considerations**: When working with large datasets (e.g., fetching thousands of users), use pagination in your API calls.

### **Week 10: Developing and Testing in Sandbox**

In Week 10, you’ll work in a **sandbox environment**—a safe, isolated area for development and testing without affecting the live production environment.

#### **1. Importance of Sandbox in SailPoint Development**
A **sandbox** is critical for testing new workflows, scripts, connectors, and upgrades before deploying them to production. It ensures that everything works as expected without disrupting business processes.

#### **2. Key Concepts**
- **Isolated Testing Environment**: Sandboxes mimic the production environment but are isolated, allowing you to make changes and test configurations safely.
- **Version Control**: Track changes in your sandbox using Git or similar version control tools. This helps you maintain a history of modifications and easily roll back changes.
- **Data Sync with Production**: You can periodically sync the sandbox with production data to ensure tests reflect real-world scenarios.

#### **3. Hands-on Practice**
- **Task 1: Setting Up Your Sandbox**
  - Set up a sandbox environment with key components (identities, applications, policies) similar to your production environment.
  - Use sample data to create test users, roles, and policies for experimentation.

- **Task 2: Testing Custom Rules in Sandbox**
  - Implement a custom **Provisioning Rule** in your sandbox. For example, write a rule that automatically grants a new hire access to certain applications based on their department.
  - Run the workflow and monitor how it interacts with other parts of the system.

- **Task 3: Deploy and Test a New Connector**
  - Add a connector for a new external application (e.g., ServiceNow).
  - Test the data aggregation and provisioning from your sandbox.

#### **4. Best Practices**
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Ensure you have ways to rollback changes if something goes wrong in the sandbox.
- **Frequent Testing**: Test regularly as you develop and keep an eye on logs for any errors.
- **Team Collaboration**: If working with a team, ensure sandbox environments are configured consistently to avoid conflicting results.

### **Week 11: SailPoint Upgrade and Maintenance**

In this week, you'll learn about **SailPoint upgrades** and maintaining the system for optimal performance. SailPoint frequently releases new versions, and keeping up-to-date is crucial for security and new features.

#### **1. SailPoint Upgrade Process**
Upgrading SailPoint (e.g., from version 8.1 to 8.2) involves several steps:
- **Pre-Upgrade Preparation**: Ensure all custom scripts, rules, and workflows are backed up. Review SailPoint’s release notes to understand new features and potential impact on existing customizations.
- **Running the Upgrade**: Follow SailPoint’s official upgrade process to install the new version on your servers or cloud environment.
- **Post-Upgrade Testing**: After upgrading, test key functionalities (e.g., provisioning workflows, access certifications, and integrations) to ensure nothing is broken.

#### **2. Hands-on Practice**
- **Task 1: Simulate an Upgrade in the Sandbox**
  - Back up all configurations, workflows, and custom rules.
  - Run an upgrade from an older version to the latest (simulated in the sandbox).
  - Verify that all custom rules/scripts still work after the upgrade.
  
- **Task 2: Post-Upgrade System Check**
  - After upgrading, test critical functionality:
    - Are provisioning workflows still working?
    - Are certification campaigns unaffected?
    - Are connectors still syncing data correctly?
  - Generate reports to validate that identity data is intact.

#### **3. Performance Tuning**
- **Query Optimization**: Review and optimize SQL queries in reports or data aggregation tasks. SailPoint’s data model can be complex, so ensuring queries run efficiently is key to improving performance.
- **Log Review**: Regularly review system logs to identify any bottlenecks or potential errors in workflows, provisioning, and certifications.
- **Scaling SailPoint**: Depending on the number of identities, roles, and connected applications, you may need to fine-tune SailPoint for high availability and better performance.

#### **4. Best Practices**
- **Frequent Testing in Sandbox**: Before upgrading production, ensure thorough testing in your sandbox environment.
- **Plan for Rollbacks**: Always have a rollback plan in case the upgrade introduces issues.
- **Document the Process**: Keep detailed documentation of the upgrade process, including any customizations you had to reapply after the upgrade.

### **Week 12: Final Project and Review**

This week is about applying everything you've learned in a real-world scenario and reviewing key concepts to solidify your knowledge.

#### **1. Building a Full Workflow and Integration Solution**
- **Project Idea**: Implement an end-to-end **user lifecycle management workflow** that automates onboarding and access requests for a new hire. It should involve:
  - Creating a new user in SailPoint.
  - Assigning roles and entitlements based on the user's department.
  - Sending approval requests to the manager.
  - Provisioning the user to multiple applications like Active Directory and Salesforce.
  - Sending notification emails upon successful provisioning.

#### **2. Hands-on Practice**
- **Task 1: Build and Test the Workflow**
  - Use a mix of custom rules, workflows, and integration connectors.
  - Test the entire flow in your sandbox, from identity creation to provisioning.
  - Add error handling to ensure smooth operations in case any step fails.

- **Task 2: Generate Custom Reports for Auditing**
  - Create a custom report that tracks all provisioning activities for new hires over the past month.
  - Schedule the report to run automatically and send results via email to the compliance team.

#### **3. Review and Optimize**
- **Refactor**: Review your custom workflows and scripts for any improvements. Are there areas where you can reduce redundancy or improve performance?
- **Seek Feedback**: If you have colleagues or mentors, ask them to review your project and provide feedback.
